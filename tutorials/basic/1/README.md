## What is programing languages

A programming language is a formal language comprising a set of instructions that make computer do something.

Computer (CPU) only understand instructions in binary code. Binary code is hard for human being to create and manage. Programming languages are created as an bridge from human language to the binary code, which computer can understand and execute directly.

Programming languages must be translated to the binary code before computer can run it. This translation is call __"compiled"__ or __"interpreted"__. No matter what programming language used, you must use a compiler or interpreter to convert it into a form that computer can understand, which is binary code.

### Popular languages
There have been many computer languages created. Lots of them are not being actively used, while some are still very popular.

- C/C++

C is a general purpose procedural programming language. First developed at early 1970s, it is still being used widely used various platforms, especially in OS and device driver level.

C++ is an extension of the C language. It is object oriented and also available on various platforms.

- Java

First developed in 1995, Java is a general purpose, class-based object oriented language. The compiled code from Java program is not binary code, but JVM byte-code. It can be run on any computer system that has JVM installed.
Java has very wide application on desktop application, web application, and mobile app.

- .NET

.Net is a set of programming language that can run on Microsoft .Net framework.

- Python

Python is an interpreted general purpose language created in 1991. It was designed to write easy to understand program.

## Python

Python programming language is easy to learn for beginners. You can use Python to write simple, efficient programs really quickly.
Python doesnâ€™t have complicated symbols, like braces ( { } ), hashes ( # ), and dollar signs ( $ ), which make other programming languages a lot more difficult to read and understand for beginner.

### Install Python

- On windows
- On Mac OS
- On Ubuntu

### Run your first Python program

- Run it in python console

```shell script
python3
```

Then run the following

```console
>>> print("Hello World")
```

Use `quit()` to exit python console

- Run it as a python file

Save the following into a file say `myfirst.py`

```python
print("Hello World")
```
